▪ The data for the analysis has been taken from the Individual survey schedule of the LASI (Longitudinal 
Ageing Study in India), Wave 1 (2017-18) conducted by the International Institute for Population 
Sciences in Mumbai, India, Harvard School of Public Health, and University of Southern California 
(USC). The LASI Wave-1 target population included all Indian adults and elderly men and women aged 
45 and above, as well as their spouses living in the same household, regardless of their age. It covered 
a panel survey of 72,250 people in Wave 1. The study involved 65,562 participants, with 18,849 and 
16,282 of them estimating the diagnosis of hypertension and depression respectively. The analysis was carried out using statistical software Stata 16.

▪ In this study, I examined the prevalence of hypertension and depression by socioeconomic and health 
behaviour factors for India and for two groups of states where the prevalence is lower and higher 
than national (India) estimates. I found that the prevalence of hypertension and depression in female 
31% and 30.4% is higher than male 23.4% and 25.6% respectively. I also examined the socioeconomic 
and health behaviour factors associated with hypertension and depression using binary logistic 
regression. The monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) quintile is a significant factor affecting 
hypertension. Poorer, middle, richer, and richest is 1.22, 1.34, 1.59, and 1.82 times more likely to 
have hypertension than the poorest group. And the education level is a significant factor affecting 
depression. Less than 5 years, 5-10 years and 10 or more years of education is 0.90, 0.82 and 0.71 
times less likely to have depression than the no education group.
